Welcome to **The Fight of Kings**, a strategy card game that leads the user to a single goal - destroying all of the opponent's towers.

  

### 🏟️ Playing Field

The screen is split into two parts with a horizontal river along the middle of the screen. **Your territory** is the **bottom** of the screen, whereas your enemy and their towers are displayed on the top half of the field. You may only summon characters on your half of the screen, and the same applies to your enemy.

  

### 🏰 Layout

Each side (you and your enemy) have **three King Towers** which have their own hp and stand evenly positioned on each battle side. Your goal is to destroy the enemy's towers using your characters and save your towers from being destroyed first.

  

### 🃏 Cards

Once you start the game you get a deck consisting of five cards, which you can use to defeat your enemy.

There are three types of characters:

- Goblin - fast and deals medium damage

- Archer - Very long-ranged, however, is slower than Goblin and deals low damage

- Giant - Very slow, but deals a tonn of damage

  

Each card has a **cost** measured in **potion points** in the top right corner of the card.

  

**To use the card:**

- Click and hold it with the left mouse button

- Drag the card onto your side of the field

- Release the card to summon.

  

Note, that if you **do not** have enough potion or are trying to place the character anywhere except for your side of the field, the card will be **returned** to your deck and an error message will be displayed.

  

### ✨ Potion points

Potion points bar and count are displayed on the top of the game screen and are gradually earned with time at an approximate speed of **2.8 points per second**. Once the amount of potion points is equal or higher than the card's cost - the card can be used and character of the corresponding type will emerge.

  

### 📃 Help screen

In the starting menu you can access the help screen of the game, which reexplains the game's goal and on the second page displays the characteristics of all three characters.

  

### ❌ Exit

To exit the game press exit or click the cross in the right top corner of the window.

  

### 🍀 Good luck!

I sincerely hope that you will enjoy playing this silly little game of mine!
