Arrows for archers

 Feedback:
- Add a 2nd page in the help screen to explain what each of the cards do.
- Move the progress bar and counter to the card holder at the bottom of the screen.
- Use a GameState enum and switch statement in the `update_screen` function.
- Add visual que when it's not possible to place a card.
- Add arrows for archers!
